THE HEROIDES X

3⁷ Thus did I cry, and what my voice could not
avail, Ι filled with beating of my breast; the
blows Ι gave myself were mingled with my words.
That you at least might see, if you could not hear,
with might and main I sent you siguals with
my hands; and upon a long tree-hranch Ι fixed my
shining veil—yes, to put in mind of me those who
had forgottenI. And now you had been swept
beyond my vision. Then at last Ι let flow
my tem-35 till then my tender ey eballs hv d been
dulled with pain. Ἄ hat better could luy eyes
do than weep for me, when Ι had ceased to see
your sails? Alone, with hair loose flying, I have
either roamed about, like to a Bacchant roused hy
the Ogygian god, or, looking out upon the sca, Ι
Ιιεινθ sat all chilled upon the rock‚ as much a stone
myself as was the stone Ι sat upon. Oft do Ι
come again to the couch that once received us both,
but was fated never to show us together again,
and touch the imprint left by you—’tis all Ι can in
place of you l—and the stuffs that onc( ,grou w. nrm
beneath your limbs. l lay mc doun upon ιιι)
face, bedew the bed with pouring te··11>‚·md cry
aloud. “We were two who pressed thee—give bzwk
two! Vi e came to thee both together3 why do we
not depart 'che same? Ah, faithless bed- th<- greater
part of my being, oh, where is he ?

⁵9 What am Ι to do? Whither shall Ι take
myself—I am alone, and the isle untilled. Of
human traces Ι see none; of cattle, none. On
every side the land is girt by sea; nowhere :i
sailor, no craft to make its way over thc dubious
paths. And suppose I did find those to go with
me, and winds, aud ship-yet where ain Ι to go?
