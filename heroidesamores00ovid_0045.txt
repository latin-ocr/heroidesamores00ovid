THE HEROIDES 11

the waters, scarce halted by the wavcs where first
the sea sends in its mobile tide. The nearer the
sails advance, the less and less the strength that
bears me up; my senses leave 1116, aud 1 fall, to be
caught up by my handmaids’ arms.

¹3¹ There is a bay, whose bow-like lines are
gently curved to sickle shape; its outmost horns
rise rigid and in rock-bound mass. To throw myself
hence into the waves beneath has been my mind3
and, since you still pursue your faithless course, so
shall it be. Let the waves bear me away, and cast
nie up on your shores, and let me meet your eyes
untombed! Though 111 hardness you be more than
steel, than adamant, than your very sels, you shall
say: “ Not so, Phyllis, should Ι have been followed
by thee !” Oft dogI long for poison; oft with the
sword would I gladly pierce my heart and pour
forth my blood in death. My neck, too, because
once offered to the embrace of your salse arms, Ι
could gladly ensnare in the noose. My heart is
fixed to die before my time, and thus make amends
to tender purity. ln the choosing of my death there
shall be but small delay.

¹⁴5 On my tomb shall you be inscribed thc hate-
ful cause of my death. By this, or by some similar
verse, shall you be known :
