THE HEROIDES IX

will even drive away Aetolian Deianira, and her rival
will lay aside the name of mistress, and be made
your wife. Iole, the daughter of Eurytus, and
Aonian Alcides will be basely joined in shameful
bonds of Hymen. My mind fails me at the thought,
a chill sweeps through my frame, and my hand lies
nerveless in my lap.

13⁷ Me, too, you have possessed among your many
loves—but me with no reproach. Regret it not—
twice you have fought for the sake of me. In tears
Achelous gathered up his horns on the wet banks of
his stream, and bathed in its clayey tide his mutilated
brow; the half-man Nessus sank down in lotus-
bearing Euenus, tingeing its waters with his equine
blood.a But why am Ι reciting things like these?
Even as I write comes rumour to me saying my
lord is dying of the poison from my cloak. Alas
me! what have I done? Whither has madness
driven me in my love? O wicked Deianira, why
hesitate to die?

¹4⁷ Shall thy lord be torn to death on midmost
Oeta, and shalt thou, the cause of the monstrous
deed, remain alive? If I have yet done aught to win
the name of wife of Hercules, my death shall be the
pledge of our union. Thou, Meleager, shalt also
see in me a sister of thine own ἶ O wicked Deianira,
why hesitate to die?

¹⁵3 Alas, for my devoted house! Agrius sits on
the lofty throne3²⁷ Oeneus is reft of all, and
barren old age weighs heavy on him. Tydeus my
brother i's exiled on an unknown shore 30 my second
brother’s life hung on the fateful fire ;d our mother

for his slaying her brother, finally burnod the brand on
whose preservation the Fates had said his life deponded.
