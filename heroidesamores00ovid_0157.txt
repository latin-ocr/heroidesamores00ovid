THE HEROIDES XI

Hymenaeus, thy wedding-torclies, and fly with
frightened foot· from these nefarious halls! Bring
for me the torches ye bear, Erinyes dark, and let
my funeral pyre blaze bright from the fires ye
give! Wed happily under 3 better fate, O my
sisters, but yet remember me though lost!

107 What crime could the babe commit, with so few
hours of life? With what act could he, scarce born,
do harm to his grandsire? If it could be he deserved
his death, let it be judged he did—ah, wretched
child, it is my fault he suffers for! O my son, grief
of thy mother, prey of the ravening beasts, ah me!
torn limb from limb on thy day of birth ; Ο my son,
miserable pledge of my unhallowed love—this was
the first of days for thee, and this for thee the last.
Fate did not permit me to shed o'er thee the tears

’ Ι owed, nor to bear to thy tomb the shorn lock3

I have not bent o'er thee, nor culled the kiss from

’ thy cold lips. Greedy wild beasts are rending in

 

 

 

< pieces the child my womb put forth.

119 Ι, too, shall follow the shades of my babe—
shall deal myself the stroke-and shall not long
ζ 113ν6 been called or mother or bereaved. Do thou,
¹ nevertheless, O hoped for in vain by thy wretched
¹ sister, collect, Ι entreat, the scattered members of
’ thy son, and bring them again to their mother to
share her sepulchre, and let one urn, however scant,
possess us both! O live, and forget me not3 pour
forth thy tears upon my wounds, nor shrink from
her thou once didst love, and who loved thee!
’ Do thou, I pray, fulfil the behests of the sister thou
ι didst love too well; the behcst of my father 1

2 shall mysels perform!
