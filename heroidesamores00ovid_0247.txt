THE HEROIDES XVII

75 What you do now when our board has been
spread, oh, shameless one! Ι 11150 note, though I
try to feign-when now you look on me, wanton,
with those bold eyes which my own can scarcely
meet when they (155111 me, and now sigh, and 110111
again take up the goblet nearest 1116,1111(1 youlself,
too, drink from the part where Ι 1111116 drunk. Oh,
11011 often 111116 Ι noted the covert sign} 1115 you made
with your fingers, how often those from your almost
speaking brows l And oft Ι 1111116 been in terror lest
my husband 566 it, and have reddened at the signs
you did not well conceal. Oft in lowest murmur, or,
rather, with no sound at all, Ι 1111116 said: “He- has
110 shame for anything l '’ and this word of mine was
not false. On the round surface of the table, too, Ι
have read beneath my name, which had been writ
with the tracing of 111116ε1 ιο11Ε.Ι could not believe
you, 110116 the 1655,1111(1 signified it with 1111 eyes

may speak! These 1·116 the bl mdishments had
Ι been disposed to sin, by which l could be bent3
by these my heart could be taken prisoner. Your
beauty, toO, I confess, is rare, and a woman might
well wish to submit to your embrace3 but let
another be happy without reproach rather than my
honour fall before a stranger's love. Learn from
my example how to live without the fan-3 there
is virtue in abstinence from what delights. How
many youths, think you, desire what you desire,
and yet are wise? Or are you, Paris, the only
0116 with eyes? You see no more clearly: your
daring is only more rash ; nor have you more spirit,
but less of modesty.
