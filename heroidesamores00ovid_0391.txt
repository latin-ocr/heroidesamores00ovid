THE AMORES Ι. xiv

they yield themselves to iron and fire to form the
close-curling ringlet with its winding orb! I kept
crying out: α’Τ is crime, 't is crime to burn those
tresses! They are beautiful of themselves; spare
your own head, O iron-hearted girl! Away from
there with force! That is no hair should feel the
fire; your curls themselves (an school the ilons you
apply ! '²

31 The beautiful tresses are no more—such as
Apollo could desire, such as Bacchus could desire,
for their own heads ἔ Ι could compare with them the
tresses which nude Dione is painted holding up of
yore with dripping fingersfl‘ Why do you lanient the
ruin of your ill-ordered hair? why lay aside your
mirror with sorrowing hand, silly girl? You are
gaze‘d upon by yourself with eyes not well accustomed
to the sight3 to find pleasure there, you must forget
your old-time self. No rival's enehanted hei-bs have
wrought you 111, 110 treacherous grandam has laved
your hair with water from Haemoniam land3b nor
has violent illness harmed-far from us be the omen !
*nor envious tonoue diminished 30111· dense locks.
The loss you feel was vn ouoht 3011 byyour own hand

women; you will be adorned by the bounty of the
race we lead in triumph. O how oft, when someone
looks at 30111“111111·,11’111 3011 redden, and say: “The

'T is some Sygambrian woman that yonder one is
praising now, instead of me. Yet I 1·en1e1nber when
that glory was my own.’'
