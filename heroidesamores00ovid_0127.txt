THE HEROIDES IX

47 Is this too little for me to endure? You add
to it your stranger loves, and whoever will .1nav
be by you a mother. Ι will say nothing of Auge
betrayed in the vales of Parthenius, or of thy travail,
nymph sprung of Ormenus3 nor will Ι charge

offence of which Ι have heard—a love by which
I am made stepdame to Lydian Lamuss* The
Meander, so many times wandel-ing in the sanie

shame to bind with gold those strong ar1ns‚and to
set the gem upon that solid brawn? Ah, to think
'twas these arms that erushed the life from the
Nemean pest, whose skin now covers your left side 3
You have not shrunk from binding your shaggy hair
with a woman's turban! More meet for the looks
of Hercules were the white poplar. And for you to
disgrace yourself by wearing the Maeonian zone,
like a wauton girl—feel you no shame for that?
Did there come to your mind no image of savage
Diomede, fiercely feeding his mares on human meat Ρ
Had Busiris seen you in that gai-b, he whom you
vanquished would surely have reddened for such a
victor as you. Antaeus would tear from the hard
neck the turban-bands, lest he feel shanie :it having
succumbed to an unnianly foe.

among the girls of Ionia, and been frightened at
your mistress' threats. Do you not shrink, Alcides,
