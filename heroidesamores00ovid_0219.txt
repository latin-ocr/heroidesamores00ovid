THE HEROIDES XVI

before my eyes, propelled 011 pinions swift, the
grandchild of mighty Atlas and Pleione—it was
allowed me to see, and may it be allowed to speak
of what Ι saw E—and 111 1116 fingers of the god was
a golden wand. And at the sels-same time, three
goddesses—Venus, and Pallas, and with her „luno-—
set tender feet upon the sward. Ι was mute, and
chill tremors had raised my hair on end, when
“Lay aside thy sear! '’ the winged herald said to
me ; “thou art the arbiter of beauty ; put 311 end to
the strivings of the goddesses; prouounce which
one deserves for her beauty to vanquish the other
two!'' And, lest 1 should refuse‚ he laid com-
mand 011 1116 111 1116 1131116 of Jove, and forthwith
through the paths of ether betook him toward the
stars.

⁷3 My heart was reassured, and 011 3 sudden I was
bold, nor feared to turn my face :md observe them
eac-h. Of winning= all were worthy, and I who was
to judge lamented that not all could win. But, none
the less, already then 0116 of them pleased me more,
and you might know it was she by whom love is
inspired. Great is their desire to win3 they burn
to sway my verdiet with wondrous gifts. Jove’s
consort loudly offers thrones, his daughter, might 111
war; I myself waver, and 6311 make 110 6110166,
between power and the valorous 116311. Sweetly
Venus smiled ε “ Paris, let not these gift-s move thee,
both of them fullos anxious fear!’' she says3 “my
gift shall be of love, 31111 beautiful Leda's daughter,
more beautiful 111311 her mother, shall come to thy
en1b1·aee.'' She said, and with her gift and beauty
equally approved, remu-ed her way victorious to the
skies.
