THE AMORES Ι. vi

enemy, who thus exclude a lover? The hours of
the night are going; away with the bar from the
doorla

331 come with no following of soldiers, and
under arms3 Ι were alone, were cruel Love not
at my side. Him, even should Ι wish, I ean nowhere
dismiss; ere that, Ι shall be divided from my very
self. And so, you see, it is Love, and moderate
wine eoursing through my temples, and a chaplet
falling from my perfume-laden hair, that are my
escort. Who would tremble before arms like these?
Who would not go to face them? The hours of
night are going; away with the bar from the door!

⁴1 You are unyielding3 or does sleep—and may it
be the ruin of you l—-give to the winds the lover’s
words your ears repulse? Yet git first, Ι remember,
when I wished to escape your eye, you were wakeful
up to the midnight stars. It may be that you, too,
have a love, who is resting even now at your side—
alas, how much better your lot than mine! Could
Ι be only in such case, come hither, hard chains, to
me! The hours of the night are going3 away with
the bar from the door !

49 Am I deceived, or did the post sound with the
turning of the hinge, and was that the hoarse
signal given by a shaken door? Ι am deceived-—it
was only the beating of a gusty wind upon the
portal. Ah me, how far has that breeze borne
away my hope l If thou rememberest well thy stolen
Orithyia, Boreas, come hither, and beat down with
thy blast these deaf doors! Through all the city
there is silence, and, wet with the crystal dew, the
hours of the night are passing; away with the bar
from the door!
