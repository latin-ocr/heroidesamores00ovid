IN APPRECIATION OF THE
HEROIDES

THE Heroides are not a work of the highest order
of genius. Their language, nearly always artificial,
frequently rhetorical, and often diffuse, is the same
throughout—whether from the lips of barbarian
Medea or Sappho the poetess. The hemines and
heroes who speak it are creatures from the world of
legend, are not always warm flesh and blood, and
rai-ely communicate their passions to us. The critic
who cares more for the raising of a laugh than for
the strict rendering of justice may with no great
difficulty find room here for the exercise of his wit.

Yet the malicious critic of the Heroides will be
hard to find 3 for they belong to the engaging sort of
art which disarms criticism. Their theme, first of all,
is the universal theme of love—and of woman's love
—and of woman's love in straits. The heroines that
speak to us from Ovid’s page may lack in eonvincing
quality, and may not stir our passions, but they are
sufficiently real to win our sympathy, and to blind us
for the moment to the faults of both themselves and
their sponsor. Their lang-uage may be unvarying,
and may bordei· too much on the rhetorical, but it is
full-flowing, clear, euphonious, and restful. It may
be artificiaL but its very artificiality is of charming
quality.
