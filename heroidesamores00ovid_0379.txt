the rich3 they have wherefroni to give you when
you ask. Pluck from full vines the hanging clusters ;
let the genial field of Alcinous yield its fruits! He
who is poor counts out to you as pay his service,
zeal, and faithfulness‚ · the kind of wealth each has,
let him bring it all to the mistress of his heart.

asking of a price, that Ι dcspisc and hate. What I
refuse at your demand, cease only to wish, and I
will give !
