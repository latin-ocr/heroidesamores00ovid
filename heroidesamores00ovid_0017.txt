OVID'S LIFE

At the age of nineteen, Ovid mourned the death
of his only brother. The poet was three times
married—twice with divorce as a hasty result, and
the third time to a lady of one of the oldest and
most respected families of Rome, the Fabii. The
last union seems to have been based upon serious
affection, or, at least, esteem, and remained un-
broken to Ovid’s death. A daughter, Perilla, is
said to have been born of this marriage. In 8 A.1).,
the poet was suddenly banished by Augustus—with-
out loss of property or citizenship, however—to
Tomi, a distant town on the Black Sea, where he
’ dragged out a miserable, though poetically pro-
ductive, existence until his death in the year 18 at
the age of sixty-one. The cause of his banishment
is generally supposed to have had some connection
with the scandalous conduct of the Emperor's
granddaughter J ulia.

Ovid's literary activities began at about his
twentieth year, and extended over a period of nearly
forty years. His works fall naturally into three
groups: the amatory poenis, consisting of the
Amores, the Heroides, De DIedicamz'ne Faciei, Ars
Amatoria, and Remedia Amoris, were the works of his
youth ; in the following period appeared two poeuis,
the Fasti and the DIeiamoaeplzoses, which may be
described as 1nythological; and the final products
of his pen, the Tristia and the Epistulae m· Ponto,
came from Tomi, and were in the nature of laments.
All of these poems have been preserved. The
Medea, a Gigantomachy, a Panegyric of Augustus
after his death, a Parody on Bad Authors, and a
poem in the language of the Getae, may be
mentioned among works which have been lost.
