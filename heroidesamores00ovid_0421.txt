THE AMORES II. viii

17 And look now2 a fresh charge! Cypassis, the
deft girl that tires your hair, is cast at me, accused
of wronging her mistress’ couch. Ye gods grant 1ne
better, if Ι have a mind to sin, than find my pleasure
in a love of mean and despised lot 3 What man that
is free would willingly mate with a slave, and clasp
11 waist that was eut with the lash? Add that her
work is to dress your hair, and she. pleases you with
the ministry of 1161 cunning 111111(1; of course Ι would
ta·mpe1 with a servant so faithful to you! With what
issue, except to be repulsed, and then betrayed?
By Venus I swear, and by the bows of her winged
boy, I 11111 not guilty of the charge you bring !

VIII

PERFECT in setting hair aright iu a thousand ways,
but worthy to dress only that of goddesses, Cypassis,
you whom I have found in our stolen delight not
wholly simple, apt for your mistress’ service, but inore
apt for mine—who is the tattler h 113 told of our
coming together? Where did Corinna get wind of
your affair with me? 01111 Ι 111· W( 111113116(1. Ρ 01111 Ι
1111ν6 let slip a single w·01d that gave 11 tell- tale sign
of our stolen love ?

⁹ Well, suppose Ι did contend that he who could
lose his· heart to a slave was out of his senses? The
Thessalian took fire at the charnis of the slave Briseis:
a slave, Phoebas, was loved by the Mycenean chief.
I 11111 neither greater than Tantalus' son, nor greater
than Achilles; why should I judge base for 1116 what
was fit for kings?
