THE AMORES ΙΙΙ. xii

person I love. Thus I can live neither with you
nor without, and seem not to know my own heart's
prayer. I would you were either less beauteous or
1033 base; beauty so fair mates not with evil ways.
Your actions merit hate, your face pleads winningly
for love—ah Ι wretched me, it has more power than
its owner’s misdeeds.

45 Spare me, O by the laws of love’s comradeship,
by all the gods who oft lend themselves for you to
deceive, and by that face of yours, to me the image
of high divinity, and by your eyes, that have taken
captive mine! Whatever you be, mine ever will
you be ; choose you only whether you wish me also
willing, or to love because constrained! Let me
rather spread my sails and use the favouring breeze,
that I may wish, though against my will, for love’s
constraint.

WHAT day was that, ye birds not white, 011 which
you chanted omens ill-boding to the poet ever in
love? or what ill star shall I think is rising on my
fate, or what gods shall I complain are nicwing war
against me ? She who but now was called· my own,
whom I began alone to love, must now, I fear, be
shared with many.

'‘'Am Ι mistaken, or is it my books of verse
have made her known? So will it prove—’tis my
genius has made her common. And I deserve it!
for why was Ι the criel· of her beauty? Through
my fault she I love has become a thing of sale. l
