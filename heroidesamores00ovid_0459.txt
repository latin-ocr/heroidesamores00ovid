would come when you would wate-h hel· well, that I
might trick you well. You are slow, and endure
things unendurable to any husband3 but ah ! for me,
your complaisance will be the end of love !

from seeing her? Shall the night nevel· threaten
me with someone’s revenge? Arn I 'co fear nothing?
Shall I heave no sighs in the midst of my slumbers?

a husband who is a pander? With his failing he
ruins our joys. Why not seek another, whom such
long-suffering pleases? If you pleasc to have me
your rival, forbid it !
