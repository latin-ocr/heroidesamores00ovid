THE HEROIDES XIX

2⁰¹ You are hurt, 110 doubt, by this omen of luy
death, and my letter in this part stirs your displeasurm-
l cease—-no inore complain3 but, that the sea, too,
may end its anger, add, Ι beseech, your prayers to
mine. I need a brief space of calin until l cross to
you; when Ι shall have touched your shore, let the
storin rage on ! Yonder with you is an apt ship-yard
for my keel, and in no waters rests my bark more
safe. There let Boreas shut 1116 111, where tarry-
ing is sweet! Then will Ι be slow to swinl, then
will I be ware, nor cast'revilenient on the 1111116111·-
ing floods again, nor eomplain that the sea is rough
when I fain would swim. Let ine be stayed alike
by the winds and your tender arms, and let there 116
double cause to keep me there !

215 When the storin permits, I shall make use of
the oar-<ige of my arms; do you only keep ever the
beacon-light where Ι shall see! Meanwhile, iny
letter in my stead be with you throughout the night.
I pray to follow it myself with least delay !

H ano To LEANDER

T ΗΑΤ Ι may enjoy 111 very truth the greeting you
have sent in words, Leander, () come! Long to
1116 is all delay that defers our joys. Forgive 1116
what I say—I cannot be patient for love ! We burn
with equal fires, but Ι ani not equal to you in
strength ; men, methinks, must have stronger natures.
As the body, so is the soul of tendor women frail—
delay but a little longer, and I shall die !
