OVID’S LIFE

Though composed after the Amores, the Heroides
are placed first in this volume because the Amores
in their extant form were the result of a revision
by the poet, who first published them in five books.
The present tendency may be said to favour the
assumption that the last six of the Heroides, in
spite of suspicious irregularities in form and lan-
guage, represent a reawakening of the poet's
interest in this field at a period later than the
appearance of the first fifteen—possibly during or
shortly after his composition of the Metamorphoses.
