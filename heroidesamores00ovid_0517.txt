THE AMORES III. xiv

to feign. She does not sin who can deny her sin,
and 'tis only the fault avowed that brings dishonour.
What madness is this, to confess in the light of day
the hidden things of night, and spread abroad your
sceret deeds? Even the jade that receives some
unknown son of Quirinus is carcful first to slip the
bolt and exclude the crowd; and you-will you
expose your faults to the 1nercy of evil tongues
and be the informer to tell of your own misdeeds?
Put on a better mind, and imitate, at least, the
modest of your sex, and let me think you honest
though you are not. What- you arc doing, continue
to do ; only deny that you have done, nor be ashamed
to use modest speech in public.

¹⁷ There is a spot that calls for wantonness; fill
that with all delights, and let blushing be far away.
Once you are forth from there, straight lay all lewd-
ness aside, and leave your faults in the couch . . .
Put on with your dress a face that shrinks from
guilt, and let a modest aspect deny the liarlot’s trade.
Chcat the people, cheat 111e; allow me to mistake
through ignorance‚ to cnjoy a fool's belief in you 1

31 Why must I see so often the sending and
getting of notes? Why that your couch has 116611
pressed in every place? Why do I gaze on hair
disordercd by more than ι616611, and see the mark
of a tooth upon your neck? You all but bring
your sin before niy very cyes; if you hcsitate to
spare your name, at least spare me 3 My mind fails
nie and Ι suffer death each time you confess your

sin, and through my fraine the blood runs cold.
