THE AMORES ΙΙ. ii

35 But let her sometimes none the less cross words
with you, too, and feign to weep, and call you
executioner. You, 111 turn, will charge her with what
she can safely explain away3 by false accusation take
away faith in the true. In this way will your honour
ever increase, in this way your pile of savings grow
high. Do this, in short time you will be free.

41 Do you note that tellers of tales wear chains tied
round their necks? The squalid dungeon is the
home of hearts barren of saith. Tantalus seeks for
water in the midst of waters and catches at ever
escaping fruits—that was the fate 116 got for his
garrulous tongue. Juno’s watchman, guarding Io
too intently, falls before his time; she—becomes a
goddess! Ι have seen in shackles the livid legs of
a man who had forced a husband to know himself a
cuckold. The punishment was less than he deserved.
His evil tongue brought harm to two; the hus-
band suffered grief, the wife the loss of her good
name. Believe me, accusations are welcome to no
husband, nor do they please him, even though 116
11631. If he is cool, you bring your traitorous tales
to careless ears3 if he loves, your service only makes
him wretched.

⁵5 Nor is a fault, however manifest, an easy thing to
prove3 the wife comes off unharmed, safe in the favour
of her judge. Though he himself have seen, he will
yet believe when she denies, accuse his own eyes,
and give himself the lie. Let him but look on his
lady’s tears, and he himself, too, will begin to wail,
and say: “The gabbler that slandered you shall pay
for it 1'' Why enter on a contest with odds against
you? You will lose and get a flogging in the end,
while she will look 011 from the lap of her judge
