THE HEROIDES XVIII

wretched lover has but' small part in you, and when
the sea grows turbid my beart is turbid‚ too. Of
what avail to me that the billows are not broad that
sunder us? Is this brief span of wate-rs less an
obstacle to me? Ι almost would that Ι were distant
from you the whole world, so that my hopes were
far removed, together with my lady. Now, the
nearer you are, the nearer is the flame that kindles
me, and hope is always with 1116, not always she
Ι hope for. Ι can almost touch her with my hand,
so near is she I love; but oft, alas! this “almost'’
starts my tears. What else than this was the catch-
ing at elusive fruits, and pursuing with the lips the
hope of a retreating stream Ρ a

1⁸3 Am Ι, then, never to embrace you except when
the. wave so wills, and shall no tempest see me
happy? and, though nothing is less certain than the
wind and wave, must winds and water ever be my
hope ? And yet it still is summer. What when the
seas have been assailed by the Pleiad, and the guardian
of the Bear, and the Goat of Olenos? Either Ι
know not how rash Ι 3111, or even then a love not
cautious will send me forth on the deep. And, lest
you deem Ι promise this because the time is not
yet come, I will give you no tardy pledge of what
I promise. Let the sea be swollen still for these
few nights, and Ι shall essay to eross despite the
waves; either happy daring shall leave me safe,
or death shall be the end of my anxious love ! Yet
I shall pray to be cast up ou yonder shores, and that
my shipwreeked limbs may come into your haven3
for you will weep over me, and not disdain to touch
my body, and you will say: “ Of the death he met,
Ι was the cause !'’
