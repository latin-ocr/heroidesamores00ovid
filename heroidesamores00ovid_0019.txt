MANUSCRIPTS‚ EDITIONS‚ AND
TEXTUAL CRITICISM OF
THE HEROIDES

Tua principal manuscripts of the Heroides are

³ the following 2—-

1. Codex Parisinus 8242, formerly called Puteanus,
of the eleventh century, corrected about the
twelfth ; by universal consent the best manu-
script. It contains the Heroides and the
Amores, with omissions. Of the Heroides
there is lacking: 13 ΙΙ, 1-13; IV, 48-103;
V, 97—end3 VI, 1-49; XV; XVI, 39-142;
XX, lTss—end.

2. Codex Guelferbytanus, of the twelfth century,
with a recension in the thirteenth ; of coni-
paratively little value. XVII—XX are almost
illegible. The first hand gave to XX, 194.

3. Codex Etonensis, of the eleventh century, but
inferior to its contemporary, the Parisinus.

It contains, with various other coinpositions,
the Heroides up to VH, 157.

4. Scliedae vindobonenses, of the twelfth century,
containing fragments of Χ-ΧΧ, omitting XV,
and often serving to confirm the Parisinus.
