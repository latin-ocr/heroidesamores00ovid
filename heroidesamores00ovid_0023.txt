IN APPRECIATION OF THE HEROIDES

What the Heroides lose by reason of being the
portrayal of legend-ary characters in language removed
from ordinary life they gain from their pleasant
quality of style, and from their constant stimulation
of literary reminiscence. They should not be judged
as attempts at realistic art3 their author did not
aim at even naturalism. If we must choose, they
should be judged on the basis of their connection
rather with literature than with life.

Yet we need not choose3 we may enjoy them as
clever and genia] treatments of literary themes
enriched with enough of the warmly human to beget
in the benevolent reader the illusion of life. Pene-
lope, Briseis, Dido, and Helen no doubt interest us
mainly as figures from Homer and virgil, but even
they possess qualities that give them semblance
of reality: Penelope is faithful, Briseis forgiving,
Dido filled with despair, and Helen with vanity.
In Medea, Hypsipyle, Oenone, and Ariadne, there is
a nearer approach to real passion. The wifely
solicitude of Laodamia, the loving trustfulness of
deserted Phyllis, and the mother's grief of Canace
are still more warm with life. The stories of Acontius
and Cydippe, and in greater degree of Hero and
Leander, are so full of the romanoe of young love
that we think of neither life nor letters, bnt simply
enjoy the delightful tale. And, whatever else may
be said of his heroines, in every one of them the
poet has placed the most human of qualitiesâ€”zi heart
submissive to the power of love. All the world loves
a lover, and all the world has for a long time loved
most of the Heroides.
