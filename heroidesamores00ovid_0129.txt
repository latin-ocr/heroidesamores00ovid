THE HEROIDES IX

from laying to the polished wool-basket the hand
that triumphed over a thousand toils; do you draw
off with stalwart thumb the coarsely spun strands,
and give back to the hand of a pretty mistress the
just portion she weighed out? Ah, how often,
while with dour finger you twisted the thread, have
your too strong hands crushed the spindle! Before
your mistress’ feet . . . . and told of the deeds of
which you should now say naught—of enormous
serpents, throttled and coiling their lengths about
your infant hand; how the Tegeaean boar has his
lair on cypress-bearing Erymanthus, and afflicts the
ground with his vast weight. You do not omit the
skulls nailed up in Thracian homes, nor the mares
made fat with the flesh of slain men3 nor the triple
prodigy, Geryones, rich in Iberian cattle, who was
one in three3 nor Cerberus, branching from one
trunk into a three-sold dog, his hair inwoven with
the threatening snake3 nor the fertile serpent that
sprang forth again from the fruitful wound, grown
rich from her own burt; nor him whose mass
hung heavy between your left side and left arm as
your hand clutched his throat; nor the equestrian
array that put ill trust in their feet and dual form,
confounded by you on the ridges of Thessaly.
¹⁰¹ These deeds can you recount, gaily arrayed in
a Sidonian gown? Does not your dress rob from
your tongue all utterance? The nymph-daughter
of Iardanus“ has even tricked herself out in your
arms, and won famous triumphs froin the vanquished
‘¹ Omphale.
