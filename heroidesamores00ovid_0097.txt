THE HEROIDES VII

refuge by the sea or by the land, let her make trial
of the air3 let her wander, destitute, bel-eft of hope,
stained red with the blood of her murders! This
fate do Ι, the daughter of Thoas, cheated of my
wedded state, in prayer call down upon you. Live
on, a wife and husband, accursed in your bed l

Dmo To AENEAS

Tafis, at the sulnmons of fate, casting himself down
amid the watery grasses by the shallows of Maeander,
sings the white swan.‘¹r

3Not because I hope you may be lnoved by
prayer of mine do Ι address you—-for with God's
will adverseI have begun the words you read3 but
because, after wretched losing of desert, of reputa—
tion, and of purity of body and soul, the losing of
words is a matter slight indeed.

⁷ Are you resolved none the less to go, and to
abandon wretched Dido,b and shall the same winds
bear away from 1ne at once your sails and your
promises? Ale you resolxed, Aeneas, to brfflk at
the same time from your xnoorings·1nd from your
pledge, and to follow δί’-ἴθι the fleeting re·1l1ns of
Italy, which lie you know not where. Ρ md does new-
founded Carthage not touch you, nor her rising walls,
nor the sceptre of supreme power placed in your
hand? What is achieved, you turn your back
upon; what is to be achieved, you cver pin-suc.
One land has been sought and gained, and ever
must another be sought, through the wide world.
