THE AMORES III. viii

they did not sweep the scas, stirring the waters with
dipping oar3 the shore in those days was the utmost
path for man.

⁴¹5 Thine own genius, O human kind, hath been
thy foe, and thy wit o’er great to thine own undoing.
What boots it thee to girdlc cities with towered walls Ρ
What boots it to place the weapon in hands at
strife? What was the sea to thee-with the land
thou shouldst have been content! Why dost not
aspire to the skies‚ too, for a third dominion?
W here thou mayst, thou dost pretend to the skies
as well—Quirinus has his temple, and Liber, and
Alcides, and Caesar now. We draw from the earth,
instead of increase, the massy gold. The soldier
possesses wealth begotten of his blood. The senate
is closed to the poor—'tis rating brings office; ’tis
that gives the juror weight, ’tis¹ that makes a
pattern of the knight!

5⁷ Let them have all; let these have Campus and
Forum slaves to them, and those rulc the issues
of peace and bloody war—only let them not in
their greed buy away our loves, and let them leave
something—’tis enough—for the poor to win!
But now, though she l love match the austere
Sabine dames, he who has much to give commands
her as if a captive3 while I—ani denied by her
guard ; when it comes to me, she fcars her husband.
If I chance to have given, both guard aud husband
will leave me the whole house free! O were there
only some god to avenge the neglectcd lover, and
change to dust gains so ill-got.
