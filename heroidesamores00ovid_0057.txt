THE HEROIDES Ill

will avail something to have touched your neck with
the accustomed arms, to have seen you and stirred
your recollection by the sight of my bosom. T hough
you be cruel, though more savage than your mother's
waves, even should I keep silence you will be broken
by my bears.

¹35 Even now-——so may Peleus your father fill out
his tale of years, so may Pyrrhus take up arnis with
fortune as good as yours l-have regard for anxious
Briseis, brave Achilles, and do 110t⁶l111dl1ew1tedly
torment a wretched maid with long d1 ιιιιι out
delay! Or, if your love for me has turned to
weariness, compel the death of her whom you compel
to live without you! And, as you now are doing,
you will compe] it. Gone is my flesh, and gone my
colour· ‚ what spirit Ι still have is but sustained by
hope in y.ou IfI am left by that I shall fro to
rejoin my brotheis and my husb md— md ''twill be
no boast for you to h ιιε· bid ιι ιι om ιιι die. And
more, why should you bid me die? Draw the steel
and plunge it in my body3 I have blood to flow
when once my breast is pie··1(ed. Let me be strickeu
with that sword of volus, which, had the goddess
not said n ιι would have made its ιι ιι into the
heart of Atreus' son!

149 Ah, rather save my life, the gift you gave me!
What you gave, when victor, to me your foe, I ask
now from you as your friend. Those whom 'twere
better you destroyed, N eptuuian Pergamum affords3
for matter for your sword, go seek the foe. Only,
whether you make ready to speed on with the oar
your ships, or whether you remain, O, by your right
as master, bid me come !
