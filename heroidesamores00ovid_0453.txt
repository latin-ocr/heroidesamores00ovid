THE AMORES II. xviii

and has wound her arms about my neck and given
me a thousand kisses, to my undoing. Ι am van-
quished, and summon back my genius from the taking
up of arms to sing of exploits at home and of my
own campaigns.

13 None the less, I did begin to sing· of sceptres,
and through my effort tragedy grew in favour, and
for that task no 0116 more fit than Ι. But Love
laughed at my pall and painted buskins, and at the
sceptre I had so promptly grasped in my unkinglike
hand. From this ambition‚ too, the worshipful will
of my lady drew me away—for she liked it not—and
Love triumphant drags in his train the buskined
bard.

19 What Ι may, I do. Ι either profess the art of
tender love “—ah 1116, Ι 11111 caught in the. suares of
my own teaching !—0r I write the words Penelope
sends her Ulysses, and thy tearful plaint, abandoned
Phyllis ; what Paris and Marc-arcus are to read, and
what ungrateful ι1115011, and Hippolytus, aud Hip-
polytus' sire3 and what pitiable Dido, with drawn
blade in her hand, indites‚ and the Lesbiam loved of
the Aonian lyre.b

ends of the earth and brought back missives writ in
far-distant places lc Spotless Penelope 11115 recognized
the seal of Ulysses; the stepdame has read what was
penned by her Hippolytus. Already (levout Aeneas
has written back to wretched Elissa, and a letter is
here for Phyllis to read, if only she live. A missive
grievous for Hypsipyle has come from ιΙ115(111; the
daughter of Lesbos, her love returned, may offer to
Phoebus the lyre she vowed.
