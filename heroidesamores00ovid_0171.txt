THE HEROIDES XI!

and beat my breast and cried ahmd, and my eheeks
were at the merc-y of my nails. My heart impelled
me to rush into the midst of the mm‘ing throng, to
tear off the wreaths from my ordered looks : I searee
could keep from crying out, thus with hair .·ι11 torn,
‘⁴‘ He is mine ! ’' aud laying hold 011 you.

159 Ah, injured father, rejoiee! Rejoiee, ye Col-
ehians whom Ι left Ι Shades of my brother, receive
in my fate your sacrifice due; I am abandoned:
I have lost my throne, my native soil, my home,
my husband—who alone for me took 'the place of
all! Dragons and maddeued bullss, it seems, I could
subdue3 a man alone Ι could 110133 1, who could
beat back fierce fire with wise drugs, have not the
power to escape the flames of my own passion.
My very incantations, herbs, and arts abandon me:
naught does my goddess aid me, naught the sacrifice
y I make to potent Hecate. Ι take 110 pleasure in the.
day; my nights are watches of bitterness. and gentle
sleep is far departed {rom my wretched sunl. I, who
could eharm the dragon to sleep, ean bring none
to myse1f3 my effort brings more good to any one
else soever than to me. The limbs Ι saved. a
wauton now embraces3 ’tis she who reaps the fruit
of my toil.

1⁷5 Perhaps, too, when you wish to make boast to
your stupid mate. :md say what will pleasure her
11njustears, you will fashion strange slanders against
my face and against my ways. Let her make met-ry
and be joyful over my faults! Lot her make merl-y.
and lie alost 011 the Tyrian purple—she shall weep, :md
the flamesa that consume her will surpass my own !
While sword and fire are at my hand, aud the juiee
of poison, no foe of Medea shall g«) unpunished !
