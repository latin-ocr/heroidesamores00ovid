THE HEROIDES II

2⁷ Tell 1116, what haue Ι (10116, except not wisely
love ?—and by the very fault Ι might well have
won you for my own. The 0116 crime which may 116.
charged to me is that Ι took you, O faithless, to
myself3 but this crime has all the weight aud
seeming of good desert. The bonds that should
hold 11011, the faith that you swore, where are
they now ?—and the pledge of the right hand you
placed in 1111116, and the talk of God that was ever on -
your lying lips? Where now the bond of Hymen
promised for years of life together—promise that was
my warrant and surety for the wedded state? By
the sea, all tossed by wind and wave‚ 01161· which you
had often gone, over which you were still to go; and
by your grandsire-—unlcss 116, too, 15 but a fiction——
by your grandsire, who callus the wiudwrought wave,
you 5111016 to 1116; 1165, and by Venus and the
weapons that wouud 1116 all too much—one wcapon
the bow, the other the ἴοι-61η :uid by Juuo, the

kindly ward of the brida] bed3 and by the mystica]
rites of the goddess who bears 1116 torch. Should
all the many gods you have wrouged take vongeance
for the outrage to their sacred names, 110111· single
life would not suffice.
