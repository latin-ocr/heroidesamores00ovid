THE AMORES ΙΙ. ix

the quarry that flies; what he has taken he leaves
behind, and ever strains to the prey ahead. We, a
people who have surrendered ’co thee, feel the weight
of thy weapons; with the foe that resists, thy hand
is slow to move. Of what avail to blunt thy barbed
arrows on naked bones ?—for love is leaving my
bones naked. So many men there are without love,
without love so many maids l—there is thy field for
great. and glorious triumph. Rome, had she not
employed her powers against the boundless world,
would be filled even now with straw-thatched huts.
19 The tired-out soldier is le’c retire to the acres he
received ; the race-horse free from the course is sent
to the pastures ; and the long docks receive to cover
the drawn-up ship of pine, and the harmless foil a is
claimed when the sword has been laid aside. I, too,
who have served so oft in 'che wars of woman’s love
—’twere time, my labours o'er, Ι lived in peace.

‘⁶ LAY aside thy loves,'’ should some god sayto me,.
“and live without tl1em‚'' I would pray him not ask
it—even so swee’c an evil are the fair. When Ι have
grown weary of love and the ardour of my heart has
cooled, my soul is somehow seized upon by a whirl-
wind of wretchedness. As a hard-mouthed horse
bears headlong in flight the master who strives in
vain to hold him back with foaming bit3 as on a
sudden, when land is now all but gained and the
keel is touching the haven, the wind sweeps it out
to the deep—so am I oft carried away again by the
veering gale of Cupid, and bright Love takes up
again the weapons Ι know well.
