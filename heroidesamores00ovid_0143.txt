THE HEROIDES X

Minos, whose mother the child of Phoebus, and who
—what memory holds more close—was promised
bride to you Ι When Ι have looked on the sea, and
on the land, and on the wide-stretching shore, Ι

not given thee the thread to show the way of thy

once for all by everlasting night. Yon, too, were
cruel, O winds, and all too well prepared, and you
brewes, eager to stan-t ιιι)Υ tem-s. erm—l tlu- right
hand that has brought nlo and my brother to «ιιιι-
death, and cruel the pledge—an empty wordssthat
