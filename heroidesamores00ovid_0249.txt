THE HEROIDES XVII

1⁰31 would the time of your swift keel's coming
had been when my maiden hand was sought by
a thousand suitors; had l seen you, of the thou-
sand you would have been the first. My husband
himself will pardon this judgment of mine. You
come late—to joys already seized on and possessed ;
your hope has been tardy3 what you seek, another
has. Grant, none the less, that I longed to become
your bride at Troyj even so think not Menelaus holds
me against my will. Cease, I pray, to pluck with
your words at my faltering heart, and do not give
pain to her you say you love ; but allow me to keep
the lot that fortune has given, and do not covet to
1ny shame the 811011 of my honour.

115 You say Venus gave her word for thisg and
that 111 1116 vales of Ida three goddesses presented
themselves unc-lad before you; and that when one of
them would give you a throne, and the second glory
in war. the third said : ‘⁴ The daughter of Tyndareus
shall be your bride!’' 1 61111 8611166 believe that
heavenly beings submitted their beauty to you
118 arbiter: and, grant that this is true, surely the
other part of your tale is 11611011, 111 which l am said
to have been given you as reward for your verdiet.
I am not so assured of my charnis as to think myself
the greatest gift 111 1116 divine esteem. My beauty
is content to 116 approved 111 1116 eyes of 111611; 1116.
praise of Venus would bring envy on 1116. Yet I
attempt 110 denial; I am even pleased with the
praises you report—for why should my words deny
what I 11111611 desire? Nor be offended that I am
over slow to believe in you ; saith 18 wont to 116 slow
in matters of great moment.
