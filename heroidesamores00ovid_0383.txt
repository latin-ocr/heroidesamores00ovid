THE AMORES I. xii

XII

Wssnp for my misfortune—my tablets have returned
with gloomy news! The unhappy missive says:
“ Not possible to-day.” There is something 111 01110113 ;
just now as Nape would leave, she tripped her toe
upon the threshold and stopped. When next you
are sent abroad, remember to take more care 113 you
cross, and soberly to lift your foot full 0110 tr!

⁷ Away from me, 111- natured table-ts,fu11ereal
pieces of wood, and you, wax close writ with char· 10-
ters that will say me nayl—wax which l think was
gathered from the flower of the long hemlock by
the bee of Corsica and sent us under its ill-famed
honey. Yet you had a blushing hue, as if tinctured
deep with minium—but that colour was really a colour
from blood. Lie there at the crossing of the ways,
where I throw you, useless sticks, and may the
passing wheel with its heavy load crush you ἔ Yea,
and the man who converted you from a tree to an'
object for 1130, l will assure you, did not have pure
hands. That tree, too, lent itself to the hanging of
some wretched neck,and furnished the cruel cross to
the executionem it gave its foul shade. to hoarse
horned owls, and its branches bore up the eggs of
the screech-owl and the vulture. To tablets like
these did I insanely commit my loves and give my
tender words to be carried to my lady? More fitly
would such tablets receive the wordy bond, for some
judge to read 111 dour tones; ’twere better they
should lie among day-ledgers, and accounts in which
some miser weeps o’er money spent.
