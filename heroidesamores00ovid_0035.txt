THE HEROIDES ll

and you not here. When once the horris of the
moon should have come together in full orb, our
shores were to expect your anchor—the moon has
four times waned, and four times waxed again to her
orb complete ; yet the Sithonian wave brings not the
ships of Actefl Should you count the days—which
we count well who love—you will find my plaint
come not before its time.

9 Hope, too, has been slow to leave 1ne; we are
tardy in believing, when belief brings hurt. Even
now my love is loath to let me think you
wrong me. Oft have I been false to myself
in my defence of you; oft have Ι thought the
gusty breezes of the south were bringing back your
white sails. Theseus I have eux-sed, because
methought he would not let you go3 yet mayhap
'tis not he that has stayed your course. At times
have I feared lest, while you were holding toward
the waters of the Hebrus, your craft had been
wrecked and engulfed in the foaming wave. Ost,
bending the knee in prayer that you fare well—ah,
wretched man!—have 1 venerated the gods with
prayer or with burning of holy incense; oft, seeing
in sky and on sea that the winds were favouring,
have I said to myself: “ If he do fare well, he is οι]
the way.'’ In a word, all things soever that hinder
those in haste to come, my faithful lovc has tried to
image forth, and my wit has been fertile in the
finding of causes. But you delay long your coming ;
neither do the gods by whom you· swore bring you
³ back to me, nor does love of mine move your
return. Demophoon, to the winds you gave at once
both promised word and sails ; your sails, alas! have
not returned, your promised word has not been kept,
