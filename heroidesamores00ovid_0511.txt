¹3 Whethei velses are oood f01 aught, I doubt;
they have always been my bane, and stood in the
light of 1111* oood. Thougli there was Thebes, though
Troy, though Caesar⁷ s deeds, Corinna only has stirred
my genius. Would that the Muses had looked 1111111
when I first touched verse, and Phoebus refused 1116
aid when my attempt was new !

19 And yet 'tis not the custom to heed the poet's
witness 3 my verses, too, I had preferred should
have no weight. 'Twas we poets made Scylla steal
from her sireff his treasured locks, aud hide in her
groin the devouring dogs 3 'tis we have placed wings
on feet, and mingled snakes with hair, our song
made Abas‘ child a victor with the winged horseJ’
We, too, stretched Tityos out through a mighty
space, and gave to the viperous dog three mouths3
we made Enceladus, hurling the spear with a thousand
arms, and the heroes snared by the voice of the
doubtful maid.c We shut in the skins of the Ithacan
the East-winds of Aeolus ; made the traitor Tantalus
thirst in the midst of the stream. Of Niobe we made
a rock, and turned a maiden to a bearst ’Tis due to
us that the bird of Cecrops? sings Odrysian Itys3
that Jove transforms himself now to a bird, and now
to gold, or cleaves the waters a bull with a maiden
on his back. Why tell of Proteus, and those Theban
seeds, the dragon's teeth; that cattle once there
were that spewed forth flames from their mouths3
