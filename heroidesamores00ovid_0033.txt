THE HEROIDES 11

97 We number only three, unused to war—a power-
less wife ; Laertes, an old man3 Telemachus, a boy.
He was of late all but waylaid and taken from me,
while making ready, against the will of all of them,
to go to Pylos. The gods grant,l pray, that our
fated ends may come in due succession—that he be
the one to close my eyes, the one to close yours ! To
sustain our cause are the guardian of your cattle
and the ancient nurse, and, as a third, the faithful
ward of the unclean stye ; but neither Laertes,
unable as he is to wield arms now, can sway the
sceptre in the midst of our foes—Telemachus, in-
deed, so he live on, will arrive at years of strength,
but now should have his father’s aid and guarding—
nor have I strength to repel the enemy from our
halls. Do you yourself make haste to come, haven
and altar of safety for your own ! You have a son——
and may you have him ever, is my prayer—who in
his tender years should have been trained by you in
his father’s ways. Have regard for Lae1·tes; in the
hope that you will come at last to close his eyes,
he is withstandiug the final day of fate.

¹15 As for myself, who when you left my side was but
a girl, though you should come straightway, 1 surely
shall seem grown an aged dame.
