129 Nev 6111161655, 111( 1t Ι 11111 not be ignorant of how
you fare, now here, now there, I oft walk anxiously
in secret before your door3 Ι follow ste ilthlly
the maid· slave and the lacke5, askimr what change
for oood your sleep has brought, 01 what youi
food. Ah me, wretched, that Ι may not be the
one to carry out the bidding of your (10610155ι
and may not stroke your hands and sit at the side of
your bed! and again wretched, because when Ι am
far 1611101* ed from you, perhaps that other, he whom
I least could wish, is with you! He is the one
to stroke those dear hands, and to sit by you 11* 11116

artery, he oft„ makes this the excuse for holding
your fair, white arm, and touches y·0ui bosom, and, it

the service given !

from the body pledged to me! 8601111ᾶ161,11111
with y·oui hands' She 11110111 you touch is to be
mine; henceforth‚ if you do that, you will be
adulterous. Choose from those who are free 0116
whom another does not elaim3 if you do not know,
those goods have 11 master of their own. Nor need
you take my word—let the formula of our pact be
re('ited; and, lest you say ’tis false, have 1161· 1·611(1
it herself! Out with you from another's ehamber,
out with you, I say! What are 5'ou doing there?
Out! 'l‘hat 6011611 15 not free! Because you, too,
