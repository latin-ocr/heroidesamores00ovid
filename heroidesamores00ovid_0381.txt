THE AMORES Ι. xi

the stealthy night and skilled in the giving of the
signal, oft urging Corinna when in doubt to come
to 1116, often found tried and true to 1116 111 times
of trouble—receive and take early to your mistress
these. tablets I have inscribed, and care that
nothing hindei· or delay! Your breast has in it
no vein of flint or unyielding iron, nor are you
Silnpler than befits your station. One could believe
you, too, had felt the darts of Cupid—in aiding
me defend the standards of your own campaigns!
Should 5116 ask how I fare, you will say ’tis my
hope of her favour that letS me live 3 as for the rest,
’tis eharaetered in the wax by my fond hand.

¹5 While Ι speak, the hour is flying. Give her the
tablets while 511615 happily free, but 110116 the less
see that she reads them straight. Regard 1161· eyes
and brow, I enjoin you, as she reads; though
she speak not, you may know froni her face
what is to eonie. And do not wait, but bid 1161·
write much in 111151161- when she has read, Ι hate
when a fine, fair page is widely blank. See 5116
pack the lines together, and long detain 1ny eyes
with letters traeed on the outerinost marge.

23 What need to tire her fingers by holding of the
pen? Let the whole tablet have writ 011 it only
this: 6((3011161” Τ11611 straight would 1 take the
eonquering tablets,and bind them round with laurel,
aud hang them 111 the mid of Venus' shrine. l
would write beneath: “ To VENUS Naso 111-1111611155 ins
parsurm. Α1115; isi-:T uu'r Now 1·ου wem: oms MEAN
