turning his feet in circle so sligl1t; whether with
strong arm you hurl the pliant shaft, your gallant
arm draws my regal-d upon itself, or whether you
grasp the broad-headed cornel hunting-spear. To say
no more, my eyes delight 111 whatsoe’er you do.

⁸5 Do you only lay aside your hardness upon the
forest ridge83 I am no fit spoil for your campaign.
What use to you to practise the ways of girded
Diana, and to have stolen from Venus her own
due? That which laeks its 31161113110113 of repose
will not endure; this is what repairs the strength
and renews the wearied limbs. The bow—and you
