THE HEROIDES IV

¹⁰⁵ There are two seas that on either side assail an
isthmus with their floods, and the slender land hears
the waves of both. Here with you will I dwell, in
Troezen’s land, the realm of Pitthcus3 yon place 13
dearer to me now than my own native soil. The
hero son of Neptune is absent now, in happy hour,
and will be absent long; he 13 kept by 1116 shores of
his deal· Pirithousfl Theseusssunless, indeed, we
refuse to own what all may 366-11113 come to love
Pirithous more than Phaedra, Pirithous more than
you. Nor is that the only wrong we suffer at his
hand3 there are deep injurios we both have had

with his triple-knotted club and soattered o’er 1116
gr0und; my sister 116 left at the mei-cy of wild
beasts. The first in cour-age among the womenl’ os

vigour of her son3 if you ask where 3111- 13-Τ11636113

safety in the pledge osso great a son. Yes, and 3111·
was not even wed to him and taken to 1113 home
with the nuptial toreh—why, 11111633 that you, a
bastard, should not come to your fathcr's throne ἓ He
has bestowed brothers on you, too, from me, and the
cause of rearing them all as heirs has been not
myself, but he. Ah, would that the 11030111 which
was to work you wrong, fairest of 111611, had 116611
rent in the midst of its throes! (io now, revel-once
the bed of 11 father who thus desei-vcs- of you—*the
bede which he neglects and is disowning by 1113
deeds.
