THE
HEROIDES OF P. OVIDIUS NASO

Ι

ΡΕΝΕιοΡΕ To Umsssss

Tms missive your Penelope sends to you, O
Ulysses‚ slow of return that you are—yet write
nothing back to me3 yourself come! Troy, to bc
sure, is ΐ’,ι116ῐι h ated of the daughters of Greece3 but
scarcely were Priam and all Troy uorth the price to
me. α Ο would that then, when his ship was on the
way to Lacedaemon, the adulterous lover had been
overwhelmed by raging waters! Then had I not
lain cold in my deserted bed, nor would now be
left alone complaining of slowly passing days; nor
would the hanging web be wearying now my widowed
hands as I seek to beguile the hours of spacious night.

Π When have I not fearcd dangers graver than
the real? Love is a thing ever filled with anxious
fear. It was upon you that my fancy ever told me
the furious Trojans would rush3 at mention of
the name of Hector my pallor ever came. Did
someone begin the tale of Antilochus laid low b)
the enemy, Antilochus was cause of my ala1m; or,

“Homer ls Ovid’ s direct source for this letter. Tenny son s
Ulysses is of interest in connection with it.

heroines write their letters, and for proper names in general,
