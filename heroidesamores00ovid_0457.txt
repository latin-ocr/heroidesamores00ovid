see that oft you be fearful of plots, and oft when
entreated Say me nay3 and allow me to stretch
myself on the threshold of your door aud suffer long·
cold through the rimy night. ’Tis thus luy lou¹

years; this 13 what helps it3 'tis 11113 that nourishcs
my passion. A love fed fat and too compliant 13
