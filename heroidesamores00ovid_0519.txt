is eager to be vanquished3 all that you need is a
tongue that remembers “I did not do it! ” When
you may win the day by a mere two words, if you
cannot through your cause, be victor through your
judge!

sires far removed, no knight created but now amid
the whirlwind of war.

whom their love of freedom compelled to honour—

pelled to grant citizenship to the Italians. The Pacligni
