AcoNTms To CYDIPPE

LAY aside your fears! here you will give no second
oath to your lover, that you have pledged youiself
to nie once is enougmha Read to the end, and so
may the languor leave that body of yours3 that it
feel pain in any part is pain to me!

5 Why do your blushes rise before you read ?—for
Ι suspect that, just as in the temple of Diana, your
modest cheeks have reddened. It is wedlock with
you that I ask, and the saith you pledged me, not a
crime3 as your destined husband, not as a deoeiver,
do I love. You may recall the words which the
fruit Ι plucked from the tree and threw to you
brought to your chaste hands; you will find that
in them you promise me what l pray that you,
maiden, rather than the goddess, will remember.
I am still as fearful as ever, but my sear has grown
keener than it was3 for the flame of my love has
waxed with being delayed, and taken on strength,
and the passion that was never slight has now grown
great, fed by long time and the hope that you
had given. Hope you had given3 my ardent

of Diana that I will wed Acontius,²' which she read aloud‚
thus inadvertently pledging herself.
