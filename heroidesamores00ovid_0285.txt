to tender maids, by these waters UHelle perished,
by them my own affiiction comes. Yet, Neptune,
wert thou mindful of thine own heart’s flames, thou
oughtst let no love be hindered by the winds—if
neither Amymone, nor Tyro much bepraised for
beauty, are stories idly charged to thee, nor shining
Alcyone, and Calyce, child of Hecataeon‚ nor Medusa
when her locks were not yet twined with snakes, nor
golden-haired Laodice and Celaeno taken to the
skies, 1101· those whose names I mind me of having
read.⁰ These, surely, Neptune, and many more, the
poets Say in their song-s have mingled their §oft
embraces with thino own. Why, then, dost thou,
who hast felt 5ο many times the power of love, close
up with whirling storm the way we have learned to

battles out upon the open deep! These waters, that
separate two lands, are ¹want. It befits thee, who art
