THERE is a certain—whoso wishes to know of a

the name of Dipsas. Her name a accords with fact—-

drop down blood3 6111115011 with blood was the face
of Luna. I suspect 5116. changes form aud flits about
in the shadows of night, 1161· aged body covered
with plumage. I suspect, and rumour 1161115 1116 out.
