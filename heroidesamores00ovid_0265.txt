THE HEROIDES XVIII

53 Meantime‚ while wind and wave deny me every-
thing, Ι ponder in my hem-t the first times I stole to
you. Night was but just beginning—for the memory
11115 61111111] for Ine—when Ι left my father’s (10015 011
the errand of love. Nor did I wait, but, flinging
away my garments, and with them my fears, I struck
out with pliant 111111 upon the liquid deep. The
moon for 'che most shed me a trenmlous light 115 I
swam, like 11 duteous attendant watehful over my
path. Lifting to her my eyes, ‘²' Be gracious to 1116,
Shinino· deitv,'' I saidy “and let the 106115 of Latmos
1156 111 thy mind. ¹ Endymion will not h· ave thee
31151616 of heart. Β611(1, O I pray thy 11166 to aid my
secret loves. Thou, a goddess, didst glide from the
skies and 56611 a 111011111 1016, 1111,11111)· it be 11110116(1
1116 to say the truth .-5116 I 56611 15 11 goddess too.
To say naught of virtues worthy of heavenly 111-611515,
beauty 11116 11615 falls to 110116 but the true divine.
After the beautiful face of Venus, and thine own,
there 15 110116 before 11615 ; 1111(1, that thou mayst
not need to trust my words, look thou thyself 1 As
much as 111] the stars 1116 1655 than thy bright fires
when thy silve—ry gleam goes forth with pure rays,
so 11111611 111016 fair 15 5116 than all the fair. If thou
dost doubt it, Cynthia) thy lig'ht 15 1)1111(1.”

⁷5 These words I spake, or words at least not differ-
ing 11111611 from these, and was borne along in the night
through waters that made way before 1ny stroke.
The wave was radiant with the image of the reflee’ted
moon, and there was 11 splendour 115 of day in the silent
night; no note came anywhere to my 6111·5,110 501111(1 but
the murmur of the waters my body thrust aside. The
Halcyons only, their hearts still true to beloved CeyX‚
, 1 heard in what seemed to me some sweet lanient.
