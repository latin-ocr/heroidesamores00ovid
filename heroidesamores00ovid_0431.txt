THE AMORES II. xi

may it be my lot when Ι die to languish in Venus’
embrace, and be dissolved in the niidst of its delight ;
and may 0116, dropping tears at my funeral, say :
“ Thine was a death accorded with thy life 1 ''

’TWAS the pine felled on Pelion's top that first
taught men the evil paths of the sea, while the waves
looked 011 111 wonder—the craft that rashly sailed
between the clashing rocks and bore away the wool
sightly with yellow flock. O that the Argo had
been o'erwhelmed and drunk the waters of doom,
so that no 0116 should trouble with oar the far-
stretching seas!

7 Lo! Corinna flies from the conch that knows
1161, and the Penates she has shared, and makes
ready to venture forth on treacherous paths. Why,
ah, wretched me I-must Ι sear for you the West-
wind and the East, and frozen Boreas, and the balniy
South? Not yonder will you gaze on towns, not
upon groves; there is only the deep-bluc- form of
the unjust sea. Nor do the waters 111 the mid of
the deep have delicate shells and painted pebbles;
for those we linger on the thirsty strand. Print ye
the strand with marble-white feet, fair maids ; so 1111·
15 safe—the rest of the way is blind. And let others
tell you tales of battling winds ; ofwaters that Scylla
makes dread, or Charybdis; of rocks where the
violent Ceraunians tower from the sea; of the fuld
in the shore where the Syrtes, great and lesser, lie
in wait. These things let others tell you ; whatever
each shall say, believe it! Believing brings no barm
from any 5101111.
