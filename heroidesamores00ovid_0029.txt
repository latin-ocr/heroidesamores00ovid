THE HEROIDES Ι

first thought! My beart leaped with fear at every
word until I was told of your victorious riding back
through the friendly lines of the Greeks with the
coursers of Ismarus.

4⁷ But of what avail to me that Ilion has been
scattered in ruin by your anns, and that what once
was wall is now level ground—if I am still to relnain
such as I was while Troy endured, and must live to
all time bereft of my lord? For others Pergamum
has been brought low; for me alone it still stands,
though the victor dwell within and drive there the
plow with the ox he took as spoil. Now are fields
of corn where Troy once was, and soil made fertile
with Phrygian blood waves rich with harvest ready
for the sickle3 the half-buried bones of her heroes
are struck by the curved share, and herbage hides
from sight her ruined palaces. A victor, you are yet
not here, nor am I let know what causes your delay,
or in what part of the world hard· heartedly you hide.

59 Whoso turns to these shores of ours his stranger
ship is plied with many a question ere he go away,
and into his hand is given the sheet writ by these
fingers of mine, to render up should he but see
you anywhere. We have sent to Pylos, the land of
ancient Nestor, Neleus’ son3 the word brought back
from Pylos was nothing sure.‘¹ We have sent to
Sparta, too; Sparta also could tell us nothing truc.
In what lands are you abiding, or where do you idly
tarry? Better for me, were the walls of Phoebus
still standing in their place—ah me inconstant,
l am wroth with the vows myself have made.
Had they not fallen, I should know where μω
were fighting, and have only war to fear, and my
plaint ννδουίἀ be joined with that of many another.
