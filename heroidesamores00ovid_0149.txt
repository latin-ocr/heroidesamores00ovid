THE HEROIDES XI

avail forme through my grandsires’ names to reach
even to the skics, to be able to number Jove among
my kin ? Is there less deadliness in the 11111116--11117
funeral gift !-that Ι hold in my woman's 11111111,
weapon not meet for me ?

2¹ Ah, Macareus, would that the hom· that made
115 two as one had come after my death l Oh why,
my b1··,0the1 did you 6161· 1016 1116 more thz 111 brotlnr,
and 11 hv h· ave I heen to 1011 11·111 ·1t ι sister should not
be? Ι, too, was mfl 1111611 by love· , Ifelt some god
in my Ο110111110· hear‚t and 1111111 him flom what I 115611
to hear he was. My 6010111· had fied from my face ;
wasting had shrunk my frame; l scarce took food,
and with unwilling mouthj my sleep was never
easy, the night was a year for me, and Ι groaned,
though stricken with no pain. Nor could Ι render
myself a reason why I did these things; 1 did
not know what it was to be in love—yet in love
Ι was.

33 The first to perc-eive my trouble, in her old
wife⁷s way, was my nurse ς 5116 first, my nurse, said ε
“ Daughter of Aeolus, thou art in love ! '’ I bhushed,
and Shame bent down my eyes into my bosom;
Ι 511111 110 word, but this was sign enough that Ι
confessed. And presently there grew apace the
burden of my wayward bosom, and my weakened
frame felt the weight of its secret load. What herbs
and what medicines did my nurse not bring to 1116,
applying them with bold hand to drive forth entirely
from my bosom—this was the only secret we kept
from you—the burden that was increasing there!
Ah, too full of life, the little thing withstood the arts

employed against it, and was kept safe from its
hidden foe!
