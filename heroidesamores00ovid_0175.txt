THE HEROIDES XIII

my ire leads, will I follow. Mayhap Ι shall repent
me of what Ι do—but I repent me, too, of regal-d for
a faithless husband’s good. Be that the concern of
the god who now embroils my heart! Something
portentous, surely, is working in my soul ἕ

LAoDA MIA To Pnorafflmus

GREETINGS and health Haemonian Laodamia sends
her Haemonian lord‚s²v and desires with loving hcart
they go where they are sent.

3 Report says you are held at Aulis by tha¹ windfl
Ah, when you were leaving me behind, where then
was this wind? Then should the scas have risen
to stay your oars; that was the fitting time for
the floods to rage. Ι could hav<- given my lord
more kisses and laid upon him more behests: and
many are the things I wished to say to you. But
you were swept headlong hence ; and the wind that
invited forth your sails was one your seamcn longed
for, not I; it was a wind suited to soe-amen, not to
one who loved. I must nceds loosc iiiyself from
your einbrace, Protesilaus, and my tongum· leave half
unsaid what I would enjoin; scarce had I time to
say that sad “ Fal-ewell ! ”

¹⁵ Boreas came swooping down, seized on and
stretched your sails, and my Protesilaus soon xva-³v sar
away. As long as I could gaze upon my lord, tn
gaze was my delight, and l followed your eyes· ert-r
displeasure because Agamemnon had killed a stag in the
grove of Diana.
