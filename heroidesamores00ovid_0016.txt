OVID'S LIFE

PUBLms Ovmms NASO was born at Sulmo, a city
about ninety miles south-east of Rome, in the country
of the Paeligni, on March 20, 43 B.c., the year of
the second triumvirate, composed of Augustus,
Antony, and Lepidus, and the year of the proscription
and death of the Ciceros. His family had been of
equestrian rank for several generations.

Ovid’s education was begun at Sulmo, and com—
pleted at Rome and Athens. In deference to his
father's wishes, he pursued, with his brother, the
rhetorical studies usual with the ambitious young
men of the time, expecting to enter upon a public
career ; but so fervent was his passion for literature,
and so irresistible his instinct 'for literary art—he
himself says that whatever he attempted to write
took the form of verse—that he found it impossible
to follow the profession of his father's preference.
He held, indeed, one or two minor offices in the
publicservice, but his chief interests were always
among the socia] and literary circles of the capital.
Among those with whom he was intimate were
Tibullus, who died when Ovid was twenty-four,
Propertius, and Aemilius Macer of Verona. Horace
and virgil were his seniors by twenty—two and
twenty-seven years respectively ; 116 heard the
former recite, and says he merely saw virgil, and
was probably well acquainted with neither.
