THE HEROIDES XIV

¹⁷ My heart is struck with fear at remembrance
of that night profaned with blood, and sudden
trembling fetters the bones of my right hand. She
you think capable of having conipassed her husband's
death fears even to write of niurder done by hands
not her own !

21 Yet Ι shall essay to write. Twilight 111ιά just
settled on the earth; it was the last part of day
and the first of night. We daughters of Inachus ‘²
are escorted beneath the roof of great 136111311113,ὁ 111ιά
0111· husbands’ fatherc himself receives the arined
brides of 1113 30113. ’ On every side shine bright the
lamps girt round with gold3 unholy incense 13
scattered on unwilling altar-fire33 the crowd cry
“ Hymen, Hyinenaeusff’ The god shuns their
cry3 ι101163 very consort has withdrawn froin the
city of her choice! Then, look you, confused with
wine, they come in rout ainidst the eries of their
6011111111110113; with fresh flowers in their ‹lripping
locks, all joyously they burst into the bridal chambers
—the bridal chmnbers, their own tombs l—and with
their bodies 111633 the couches that deserve to be
funeral beds.

33 And now, heavy with food and wine they lay in
316611,111ιά deep repose had settled on Argos, free
froin care—when round about 1116 Ι 366111611 to hear
the groans of dying 111611; nay, I heard indeed,
and what I feared was true. My blood rotreatcd,
warinth left 1ny body and soul, and on iny 1161111*-
wedded couch all chill I lay. As the gentle zephyr
sets a-quiver the slender stalk of 11111111, as wintry
breezes shake the poplar leaves, even thus—yesi,
even inore—did Ι treinble. Yourself lay quiet3 the
wine 1 111ιά given you was the wine (11316611.
