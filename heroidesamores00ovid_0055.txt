THE HEROIDES III

held sacred in my eyes; and by the brave souls of
my three brothers, to me now spirits divine, who
died well for their country, and lie well with it
in death3 and by your head and mine, which we
have laid each to each; and by your sword, weapon
well known to my kin—I swear that the Mycenaean
has shared no conch with 1ne; if I prove false,
wish never to see me more! If now Ι should say
to you: “Most valiant one, do you swear also that

you have tasted no joys apart from me!'’ you
would refuse. Yes, the Danai think you are
mourning for me—-but you are wielding the plectrum,
and a tender mistress holds you in her warm
embrace! And does anyone ask wherefore do you
refuse to fight? Because the fight brings danger3
while the zither, and night, and Venus, bring
delight. Safer is it to lie on the conch, to clasp a
sweetheart in your arms, to tinkle with your fingers
the Thracian α lyre, than to take in hand the shield,
and the spear with sharpened point, and to sustain
upon your locks the helmet's weight.

¹²¹ Once the deed of renown, rather than safety,
was your pleasure, and glory won in wal-ring was
sweet to you. Or can it be. that you favoured fierce
war only till you could make me captive, and that your
praise lies dead, o'ercome together with my native
land? Ye gods forfcnd! and may the spe-ar of
Pelion go quivering from your strong arm to pierce
the side of Hector! Send me, O Danai! 1
will be ,ambassadress and supplicate 1ny lord, and
carry many kisses mingled with my messagc. 1 shall
achieve more than Phoenix, believe mc, more than

eloquent Ulysses, more than 'l‘cucer’s brother 3 ‘¹ 11,
